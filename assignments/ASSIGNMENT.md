### TASK-1 Take a project and create microservice architecture for data collection ,Model training , model prediction. ?
Note: 
```text
1. Data collection architecture should be cost and speed optimized !
2. Data Ingestion step should be cost and speed optimized while model training !
3. There should be minimum or very less downtime for new model update in prediction. !
```

### TASK-2 Currently project is implemented using pytorch you need shift it to tensorflow 2.X and shift approximate nearest neighbor algorithm from Annoy to Faiss?
[Faiss Algorithm](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)

### TASK-3  Shift CI-CD / CI-CD-CT workflow to circleci or Jenkins?

### TASK-4 Optimize Model training pipeline code to reduce training time and cost. ? 
``` Note: You need to figure out what can be optimized there is no such boundations.```

### TASK-5 Reduce docker size of the docker image for data collection and Prediction ?

**HINT: You can combine Task-1 , Task 2, Task 3, Task 4 , Task 5 in one project.**
